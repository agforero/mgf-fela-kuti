				text: `Chet Baker was a founding pioneer of Cool Jazz due to his trumpeting and vocal skills, which helped spread jazz worldwide and engrave his name on the Genre. His artistic expression touched many and influenced more. In the words of Ruth Young, a singer, “It would be like living with Picasso.” Today, people who recognize Chet Baker’s name will know him as a figure well known for his improvisation, which impacted the jazz he had started and how it would evolve.

				text: `Chesney Henry Baker Jr. was born to a pianist and a guitarist on December 23rd, 1929; Chet Baker had to grow up in the great depression when his mother and father had to give up their musical careers and work factory jobs or grab any job that they could have. First, he lived in Oklahoma for ten years, then after moving to California, Chet Baker was given a trombone, which proved far too large for him at his age. 
        
One day, his father bought an old trumpet from a pawn shop, which wasn't for Chet, but he used it anyway. Over the next two weeks of getting a hold of this trumpet, Chet showed an astounding level of mastery; he would listen to the radio, and somehow, without reading off the music or knowing precisely what each valve press meant on the trumpet, he would match the notes he would hear with the trumpet and perfectly replicate the song.

				text: `Over thirty years, Chet Baker would make an impressive number of albums, almost 170. This all began with his most trusted associate, Gerry Mulligan, a saxophonist. Chet Baker joined his quartet in 1952 and made waves due to his natural fantastic ability. His first recorded song, "My Funny Valentine," would be a monumental moment in his career. Proceeding this in 1954, Chet Baker would record another significant album, "Chet Baker Sings". 
        
After about a year of jumping between recording studios and clubs, Chet Baker made his first European tour to record in France and to make his name well known. After returning to the United States, he would record with Gerry Mulligan and other well-known cats, such as Bill Evans and Paul Chambers, who ironically were associated with Chet Baker's opposing trumpeter, Miles Davis.

				text: `Although having to deal with drug problems almost all his life, things truly started to turn for the worse following 1957, which is when Chet Baker began to do heroin. Anywhere between this time and 1973, Chet Baker was on a severe financial decline and was in and out of jail. He would sell his belongings just to buy more drugs and support what little family connections he had left, but nothing was heavier on Chet Baker as an artist than his incident in 1966. (Gavin) 
        
Even though he changed his story from person to person, Chet Baker, while trying to get heroin from a former associate of his, had been assaulted by a group of young men, which led him to lose all of his teeth (except one). This heavily impacted his ability to play brass. Following this, Chet Baker tried to make ends meet and slowed down his performances; in 1987, he made a documentary called “Let's Get Lost” with Bruce Weber about his own life, and while in the final stages of production, Chet Baker had his final accident. (Weber)
        
On May 13th, 1988, Chet Baker was found outside the Prins Hendrik Hotel in Amsterdam where he had fallen out of his hotel room because he had slept on the window sill; he was found with heroin and cocaine in his bloodstream. (Weber)`,

				text: `Chet Baker held himself to a standard that was sometimes obnoxious in other's eyes; this could have been the way he would perform, such as not performing unless it was silent, or getting frustrated due to the inability of his fellow performers, or any other thing that would impede his ability to play or taint his reputation. However, his standard regarding stage presence was parallel to how he would play. Chet Baker had very spaced-out syncopation and little harmony in most of his works. Syncopation is the emphasis of notes on the upbeat or background, and harmony is how well the pitches and rhythm between instruments occur. Sometimes harmony can create grandeur when all instruments play together; if they don't, it can feel small. Syncopation does not happen that often in modern music, but where it appears the most often is Jazz. It’s utilized in Jazz because it can easily create crescendos without needing to read the music. This is important to know, especially for Chet Baker, because he would have varying amounts of syncopation within one song, ultimately making it mellow or velvety.

				text: "When Chet Baker was just a boy, he had an ability that some artists struggle with, “Chet Baker’s years of listening and singing popular songs constitute musical input and experience. Baker already had the skill of singing by ear when he began to play the trumpet. All that was left for him to master was the mechanics of the instrument.” And, like I previously stated, this did not take him that long, either. One of his first recordings, “Out of Nowhere” came out in 1952, when he was 23. Despite this gap, where he might have played quite a bit, he would have only played at the time for 6-10 years, which makes him look pretty new compared to other jazz musicians. Even still, this first recording truly set a precedent for his skill as it wasn't parallel with his knowledge of music. (Moore)",

				text: "Chet Baker had a natural talent that many others lacked or had to work extensively for; one of his band members at one point stated, “He didn't know what note he was hitting. He would just press the valves, and it was real easy for him to play. I hated this because I played the trumpet too and it was real hard for me to play every day, I had to practice all day long; practice scales, practice the Arban's book, chetty never practiced at all he just could play and he knew every song he could just play any tune” Even though this sounds irresponsible, to be so confident in your ability despite never practicing, Chet Baker couldn't find the reason to do such a thing. Maybe it was due to his ego or how he grew up, but he would never practice. This kind of behavior in the industry was almost unheard of as Jazz is an extremely complex genre because it relies so much on improvisation based on how the musician has felt out their instrument and their bond with the music itself. This all shows how much of a show-off Chet Baker really was. (Weber)",

				text: "Chet Baker's closest peer, Gerry Mulligan, had much to say about him, “Chet was a kind of fresh talent. He came along, there's no figuring out where his influences were, where he learned what he knew. And his facility... I've never been around anybody who had a quicker relationship between his ears and his fingers. He was just uncanny with that kind of real control; it's as simple as breathing with him. It's something that seldom happens, a talent that comes out in full bloom.” Mulligan could recognize the shining star that Chet Baker was, but despite this, he couldn't honestly describe Chet Baker’s finesse. As hard as it is to tell the gift that Chet Baker had, it was the foundation of his entire career. He was a spectacle, almost like something you'd see at a circus, something so fantastic or unique that you would remember it for the rest of your life. (Quinn)",

				text: `Chet Baker's playstyle played a large part in the making of Cool Jazz, in fact, one of the more important alias’s Chet Baker had was “The Prince of Cool '', you really can't get more on the nose. Cool Jazz started to develop among many different bands and groups on the West Coast, one of the more prominent bands was Gerry Mulligan’s pianoless Quartet, of which their last member to join was a young Chet Baker. Together they would create soft-variants of Bebop. As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggested in their book , "the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to pastel colors, while the solos of Dizzy Gillespie and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors."

				text: `Chet Baker understood that his talent was something unique, but what he did not understand was the true impact that it would have on others, Will Friedwald, a songbook historian, once said in a book he wrote, “No one, least of all Baker, seems to have fully fathomed the widespread, long-term appeal of his singing,” (Rolling Stones) 
				
While on his first tour of Europe, Chet Baker made considerable waves in terms of the overseas Jazz Scene, One of the more notable places that touched Chet Baker was between Rome and Paris. Throughout his career, Chet Baker would tour Rome, Paris, and Amsterdam, but he recorded the most in Paris in a recording studio called the Barclay Sessions. At the end of Chet Baker's life, he had toured so much in between these three that when he died, the following morning, all clubs he had played in had closed their doors in a ceremony of his legacy.

				text: "Today, Jazz is a genre that is on a slow yet steady decline. It is not dead but a ghost of its former self. Jazz derives from Blues, and Blues Derives from old slave songs; this genre tells a tale of the history of Black Americans and everything alike. At its peak, Jazz could be considered the most raw form of expression, and today, it should be viewed as a shining example of what culture can brew. Something that mixes oppression, history, and feeling. Chet Baker was not indifferent to the cause of Jazz, and by mending with it, he became a literal piece of history in America. And what better reason is there to memorize him than engraving his name on American history. (Monson, Ingrid)",
