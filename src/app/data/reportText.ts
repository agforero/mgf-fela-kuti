Composer, saxophonist, keyboardist, dancer. Would-be candidate for the Nigerian Presidency. There will never be another like him.”_ (Saleh)

On February 18th, 1977, the Kalakuta Republic, home of Fela and Ransome Kuti, and its surrounding neighborhood were walled off and cornered by some 1000 Nigerian soldiers. Citizens were beaten, women were raped, Fela Kuti was viciously assaulted, and Ransome Kuti died due to the injuries sustained during the invasion. Why had this happened? (Kalakuta)

To answer this question, we must first establish who Fela Kuti was and what he did, even though it's difficult to portray the scope of his work.`,

				text: `Fela Kuti was born on October 15th, 1938, to Israel and Funmilayo Ransome Kuti. His father was an essential figure in Nigerian education at the time, and his mother was a world-renowned feminist and successful political campaigner for women's rights in the political field. As you can imagine, Fela grew up with a fair amount of wealth due to his parent's positions, both socially and economically. Because of this, he had the opportunity to go to private school, join a choir, and learn piano from a young age. Though much better off than most, his family did an excellent job fostering his critical thinking skills and preventing him from falling into blind elitism. From a young age, Fela was very attuned to understanding his environment and every falsity and inequality surrounding him in British colonial Nigeria. In addition, his family showed him their Yoruban roots and their importance to their people; this was a significant factor behind the growth of his anti-colonial and imperialistic ideologies.

Although his parents wanted him to be a doctor, they knew how important it was to allow him to find his path, and so when it was time for Fela to go to college, he went to Trinity College for Music in London. (Olaniyan)

For his entire life, Fela Kuti was relentless and determined to bring justice. This came in many forms, but he vocalized it through the most efficient way: his music, Afrobeat. Through his music, he spoke up about topics ranging from A to Z, whether it was about the Anti-Apartheid movement, the civil rights movement, anti-imperialism, anti-militarism, anti-colonialism, and so on. On August 2nd, 1997, Fela Kuti died of the AIDS virus, and in his honor, his home was turned into a museum, and the government subsidized its creation alongside reverberating the same message that he carried to bring about a more politically aware Nigeria.

Also, because Fela had worked with James Brown, the father of Funk, he established that Afrobeat was music for the oppressed and those willing to make a difference. Everything about Afrobeat screamed that it was for the people. (Stewart)

Fela created this genre by culminating his many disagreements and digressions with the establishment, but more specifically, he wanted to find a way to make music that was authentic to the Nigerian people, and not of any European descent.`,

(Saleh) Fela coined the term "Afrobeat" and created a sound to define it. It was inspired by dissatisfaction with High Life, a form of music that dominated African recordings at the time. He was disturbed by the European emphasis on loping beats and singular guitars in High Life, as opposed to the rhythmic drums and brass-based beats of African sounds. He began using "jazz...syncopated call and response vocals and brass," and a "raw and natural honesty and energy" that came to define Afrobeat, both as a form of music and as a political avenue for commentary.” (Saleh)`,

Following Fela’s understanding that he had the ability to rile up the people in his own country, he set his eyes on a world tour, but more importantly, across Africa. His biggest goal for the genre was to unite the people of Africa, this goal would later be coined as the term Pan-Africanism, the movement to reunify Africa from its terrible colonial past.

In this song, he repeatedly mocks the Nigerian government with such examples:

_“Things dem dey do, dem dey overdo all the things dem dey do,_

_think wey black no good, an foreign things dem dey like,_

_dem go turn air condition, and close them country away."_

As confusing as these lyrics may be, he is essentially stating that the way they conduct things within the country is a direct reflection of how they were treated when they were the cattle of Europe, which is any time between The Berlin Conference (1884) and 1950, which was the beginning of the end of colonizers within Africa.

(Saleh)

In this interview conducted after the release of Colonial Mentality, Fela Kuti touches more on what he thinks of Colonialism ideologies and what any African can do about it.`,

(Tenaille) Fela’s single, Gentlemen, is a song about criticizing men who wear suits because a suit is not fit for the African sun:

_“You say you be gentleman,_

_You go suffer,_

_You go tire,_

_You go quench,_

_I be Africa man original,_

_I no be gentleman at all o!_

_Africa hot, I like am so,_

_I know what to wear but my friends don't know”_

The not-so-subtle undertones of this song say that foreign customs, such as suits, do not belong there in Nigeria, as they are not native to the Nigerian people. (Kuti)`,

				text: `Another single that was produced at the same time as Colonial Mentality was Coffin for Head of State, both of which were created with grief for his mother. This song is about Fela personally carrying his mother's coffin to a military barracks and praying for their downfall, which is something he did in real life. As the title states, this song is about Fela’s hatred for the government and how easily they fell into the temptation of manipulating their people for profit:

_“It is a known fact that for many thousand years_

_We Africans we had our own traditions_

_These moneymaking organizations_

_Them come put we Africans in total confusion”_

Fela Kuti is very on the nose when showing that he hates imperialism, as the last two lines of lyrics state his acknowledgment of companies and organizations that only exist in Nigeria to leech money and resources away from their lands. (Afolayan)`,

Even today, many sub-Saharan African countries face the issue of extreme police and military brutality, as both have absolutely no issue raping and assaulting the innocent, and this is very likely because there is little to no consequence for doing so. (Tenaille)

Almost every single problem within Fela Kuti’s life rooted from military or police brutality. The military took his mother’s life, his wives were beaten and raped, and almost every single person that was involved with him was imprisoned or persecuted in some kind of way. If anyone had something to say against the military complex, it was Fela Kuti. (Afolayan)`,
