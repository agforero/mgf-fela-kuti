				text: `_“Fela Kuti: 77 albums, 27 wives, over 200 court appearances. Harassed, beaten, tortured, jailed. Twice-born father of Afro-beat. Spiritualist, Pan-Africanist. Commune King. Composer, saxophonist, keyboardist, dancer. Would-be candidate for the Nigerian Presidency. There will never be another like him.”_ (Saleh)

On February 18th, 1977, the Kalakuta Republic, home of Fela and Ransome Kuti, and its surrounding neighborhood were walled off and cornered by some 1000 Nigerian soldiers. Citizens were beaten, women were raped, Fela Kuti was viciously assaulted, and Ransome Kuti died due to the injuries sustained during the invasion. Why had this happened? (Kalakuta)

To answer this question, we must first establish who Fela Kuti was and what he did, even though it's difficult to portray the scope of his work.`,

				text: `Fela Kuti was born on October 15th, 1938, to Israel and Funmilayo Ransome Kuti. His father was an essential figure in Nigerian education at the time, and his mother was a world-renowned feminist and successful political campaigner for women's rights in the political field. As you can imagine, Fela grew up with a fair amount of wealth due to his parent's positions, both socially and economically. Because of this, he had the opportunity to go to private school, join a choir, and learn piano from a young age. Though much better off than most, his family did an excellent job fostering his critical thinking skills and preventing him from falling into blind elitism. From a young age, Fela was very attuned to understanding his environment and every falsity and inequality surrounding him in British colonial Nigeria. In addition, his family showed him their Yoruban roots and their importance to their people; this was a significant factor behind the growth of his anti-colonial and imperialistic ideologies. (Afolayan)`,

			{
				text: `When Fela was almost an adult, his mother's side began to bloom inside him; he grew resentful against the establishment and knew he could speak his word against it. Although his parents wanted him to be a doctor, they knew how important it was to allow him to find his path, and so when it was time for Fela to go to college, he went to Trinity College for Music in London. (Olaniyan)

For his entire life, Fela Kuti was relentless and determined to bring justice. This came in many forms, but he vocalized it through the most efficient way: his music, Afrobeat. Through his music, he spoke up about topics ranging from A to Z, whether it was about the Anti-Apartheid movement, the civil rights movement, anti-imperialism, anti-militarism, anti-colonialism, and so on. On August 2nd, 1997, Fela Kuti died of the AIDS virus, and in his honor, his home was turned into a museum, and the government subsidized its creation alongside reverberating the same message that he carried to bring about a more politically aware Nigeria.

				text: `For people at the time of its relevancy, everything about Afrobeat was hot; it was inherently about rebellion and movement of both mind and body. Also, because Fela had worked with James Brown, the father of Funk, he established that Afrobeat was music for the oppressed and those willing to make a difference. Everything about Afrobeat screamed that it was for the people. (Stewart)

Fela created this genre by culminating his many disagreements and digressions with the establishment, but more specifically, he wanted to find a way to make music that was authentic to the Nigerian people, and not of any European descent.`,

				text: `“Initially, Fela sang non-political songs in Yoruba and English, but he soon started to sing anti-establishment songs, which very quickly brought him in collision with both imperialism and their local agents in power at home". (Saleh) Fela coined the term "Afrobeat" and created a sound to define it. It was inspired by dissatisfaction with High Life, a form of music that dominated African recordings at the time. He was disturbed by the European emphasis on loping beats and singular guitars in High Life, as opposed to the rhythmic drums and brass-based beats of African sounds. He began using "jazz...syncopated call and response vocals and brass," and a "raw and natural honesty and energy" that came to define Afrobeat, both as a form of music and as a political avenue for commentary.” (Saleh)`,

			{
				text: `To most people in Nigeria, this beat echoed within their souls, something about this music allowed them to identify that it represented who they were as a people, and what they were capable of.

Following Fela’s understanding that he had the ability to rile up the people in his own country, he set his eyes on a world tour, but more importantly, across Africa. His biggest goal for the genre was to unite the people of Africa, this goal would later be coined as the term Pan-Africanism, the movement to reunify Africa from its terrible colonial past.

				text: `Although Fela has plenty of work discussing the state of post-colonial Nigeria, the best example of him showing his true thoughts on this was his song Colonial Mentality (Sorrows Tears and Blood), which was made in the immediate fallout of the raid of his compound. In this song, he repeatedly mocks the Nigerian government with such examples:

_“Things dem dey do, dem dey overdo all the things dem dey do,_
_think wey black no good, an foreign things dem dey like,_
_dem go turn air condition, and close them country away."_

As confusing as these lyrics may be, he is essentially stating that the way they conduct things within the country is a direct reflection of how they were treated when they were the cattle of Europe, which is any time between The Berlin Conference (1884) and 1950, which was the beginning of the end of colonizers within Africa. (Fela and Olaniyan)`,

				text: `Part of the reason that Fela became a singer in the first place was that he realized that there was something fundamentally incorrect about the way his day-to-day life was conducted, even though his country was finally independent of colonists, and had recently exited an extremely bloody civil war, the remnants of colonialism seeped into every societal norm and branch of government. (Saleh)

In this interview conducted after the release of Colonial Mentality, Fela Kuti touches more on what he thinks of Colonialism ideologies and what any African can do about it.`,
