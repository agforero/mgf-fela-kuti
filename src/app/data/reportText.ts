				text: `_“Fela Kuti: 77 albums, 27 wives, over 200 court appearances. Harassed, beaten, tortured, jailed. Twice-born father of Afro-beat. Spiritualist, Pan-Africanist. Commune King. Composer, saxophonist, keyboardist, dancer. Would-be candidate for the Nigerian Presidency. There will never be another like him.”_ (Saleh)

On February 18th, 1977, the Kalakuta Republic, home of Fela and Ransome Kuti, and its surrounding neighborhood were walled off and cornered by some 1000 Nigerian soldiers. Citizens were beaten, women were raped, Fela Kuti was viciously assaulted, and Ransome Kuti died due to the injuries sustained during the invasion. Why had this happened? (Kalakuta)

To answer this question, we must first establish who Fela Kuti was and what he did, even though it's difficult to portray the scope of his work.

				text: `Fela Kuti was born on October 15th, 1938, to Israel and Funmilayo Ransome Kuti. His father was an essential figure in Nigerian education at the time, and his mother was a world-renowned feminist and successful political campaigner for women's rights in the political field. As you can imagine, Fela grew up with a fair amount of wealth due to his parent's positions, both socially and economically. Because of this, he had the opportunity to go to private school, join a choir, and learn piano from a young age. Though much better off than most, his family did an excellent job fostering his critical thinking skills and preventing him from falling into blind elitism. From a young age, Fela was very attuned to understanding his environment and every falsity and inequality surrounding him in British colonial Nigeria. In addition, his family showed him their Yoruban roots and their importance to their people; this was a significant factor behind the growth of his anti-colonial and imperialistic ideologies.

				text: `When Fela was almost an adult, his mother's side began to bloom inside him; he grew resentful against the establishment and knew he could speak his word against it. Although his parents wanted him to be a doctor, they knew how important it was to allow him to find his path, and so when it was time for Fela to go to college, he went to Trinity College for Music in London. (Olaniyan)

For his entire life, Fela Kuti was relentless and determined to bring justice. This came in many forms, but he vocalized it through the most efficient way: his music, Afrobeat. Through his music, he spoke up about topics ranging from A to Z, whether it was about the Anti-Apartheid movement, the civil rights movement, anti-imperialism, anti-militarism, anti-colonialism, and so on. On August 2nd, 1997, Fela Kuti died of the AIDS virus, and in his honor, his home was turned into a museum, and the government subsidized its creation alongside reverberating the same message that he carried to bring about a more politically aware Nigeria.

				text: `Chet Baker's playstyle played a large part in the making of Cool Jazz, in fact, one of the more important alias’s Chet Baker had was “The Prince of Cool '', you really can't get more on the nose. Cool Jazz started to develop among many different bands and groups on the West Coast, one of the more prominent bands was Gerry Mulligan’s pianoless Quartet, of which their last member to join was a young Chet Baker. Together they would create soft-variants of Bebop. As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggested in their book , "the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to pastel colors, while the solos of Dizzy Gillespie and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors." (Tanner)`,

				text: `Chet Baker understood that his talent was something unique, but what he did not understand was the true impact that it would have on others, Will Friedwald, a songbook historian, once said in a book he wrote, “No one, least of all Baker, seems to have fully fathomed the widespread, long-term appeal of his singing,” (Rolling Stones) 
				
While on his first tour of Europe, Chet Baker made considerable waves in terms of the overseas Jazz Scene, One of the more notable places that touched Chet Baker was between Rome and Paris. Throughout his career, Chet Baker would tour Rome, Paris, and Amsterdam, but he recorded the most in Paris in a recording studio called the Barclay Sessions. At the end of Chet Baker's life, he had toured so much in between these three that when he died, the following morning, all clubs he had played in had closed their doors in a ceremony of his legacy.

				text: "Today, Jazz is a genre that is on a slow yet steady decline. It is not dead but a ghost of its former self. Jazz derives from Blues, and Blues Derives from old slave songs; this genre tells a tale of the history of Black Americans and everything alike. At its peak, Jazz could be considered the most raw form of expression, and today, it should be viewed as a shining example of what culture can brew. Something that mixes oppression, history, and feeling. Chet Baker was not indifferent to the cause of Jazz, and by mending with it, he became a literal piece of history in America. And what better reason is there to memorize him than engraving his name on American history. (Monson, Ingrid)",
